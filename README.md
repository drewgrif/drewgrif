# 🚀 I've Moved to Codeberg!

My active development has migrated to **[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/justaguylinux)** to support community-driven, non-profit open source infrastructure.

## 🔗 Where to Find My Projects

**Primary:** [codeberg.org/justaguylinux](https://codeberg.org/justaguylinux) — All active development happens here

**Legacy:** This GitHub account remains as an archived mirror for existing clones and forks

## 📺 For YouTube Viewers

If you're here from a video:
- **Newer videos** → Links point to Codeberg
- **Older videos** → Check the pinned comment and description for updated Codeberg links
- All repos have been migrated and updated install scripts will redirect you

## ⚡ Why Codeberg?

- Truly open-source infrastructure (Forgejo/Gitea)
- Non-profit, community-driven platform
- Strong European privacy standards
- No corporate tracking or interests

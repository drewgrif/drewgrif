# ðŸš€ I've Moved to Codeberg!

Hey there! I'm migrating my open-source work to Codeberg to support a community-driven, non-profit platform.

## ðŸ”— Find Me Here:
- **New Home**: [codeberg.org/justaguylinux](https://codeberg.org/justaguylinux)
- **Active Development**: All new commits happen on Codeberg
- **This GitHub**: Will remain as a mirror/archive

## ðŸ“º YouTube Viewers:
If you came from my YouTube videos, the code is now at Codeberg!
Don't worry - the same projects, same code, just a new home.

## Why the Move?
- Support truly open-source infrastructure
- Non-profit, community-driven platform
- European privacy standards
- No corporate interests

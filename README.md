# ðŸš€ I'm Moving to Codeberg!

Hey there! I'm gradually migrating my open-source work to Codeberg to support a community-driven, non-profit platform.

## ðŸ”— Find Me On Both Platforms:
- **Codeberg**: [codeberg.org/justaguylinux](https://codeberg.org/justaguylinux)
- **GitHub**: Legacy mirror while the last few projects finish migrating
- **Migration Status**: Most active repos now live on Codeberg, with mirrors here for convenience

## ðŸ“º YouTube Viewers:
Most code is still here on GitHub! I'm gradually moving to Codeberg.
Check both places for now - links in video descriptions will be updated as repos move.

## Why the Move?
- Support truly open-source infrastructure
- Non-profit, community-driven platform
- European privacy standards
- No corporate interests

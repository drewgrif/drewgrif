# ðŸš€ I'm Moving to Codeberg!

Hey there! I'm gradually migrating my open-source work to Codeberg to support a community-driven, non-profit platform.

## ðŸ”— Find Me On Both Platforms:
- **Codeberg**: [codeberg.org/justaguylinux](https://codeberg.org/justaguylinux)
- **GitHub**: Still active here during the transition
- **Migration Status**: In progress - moving repos safely over time

## ðŸ“º YouTube Viewers:
Most code is still here on GitHub! I'm gradually moving to Codeberg.
Check both places for now - links in video descriptions will be updated as repos move.

## Why the Move?
- Support truly open-source infrastructure
- Non-profit, community-driven platform
- European privacy standards
- No corporate interests

## Recently Migrated:
- [butterscripts](https://codeberg.org/justaguylinux/butterscripts) - Now on Codeberg!

## Still on GitHub:
Most repositories remain here while I carefully migrate them.
